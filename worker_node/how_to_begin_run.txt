1. Change IP in download.py and msmutect_loop.py to correct server IP
2. download token and chmod 777
3. download newest version of gdc
4. update paths for gdc token and gdc client and make results path (from msmutect_loop.py)
5. sudo apt install samtools unzip zip python3-pip
6. Download MSMuTect and set right path in msmutect_loop.py
7. python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
8. python3 -m pip install psutil
