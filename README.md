Abbot is the code for the Principal Server of Project Texas  
Monk is the code for the worker nodes for Project Texas  
Choir is the code to go from histograms to mutations
Essene is the SNV worker node code
Scroll is the SNV principal server code   
Yes, I went overboard on the funny names

Abbot is named Abbot since it 'governs' the running of Project Texas
and Greg Abbot is the governor of Texas.  
Monk is named Monk because an Abbot is the head of a monastery, and Monks work in monasteries
Choir is named choir since it runs on the technion cluster and a cluster is a 'choir' of computers  
The entire project is named monastery because Abbots and Monks work in monasteries
